        <p>Richard A. Williams, director of photography on Since '45, is known for his work on Rogue Saints (2011),
          Red (2010) and Stop Requested (2013). His work on Since '45 so far is, naturally, outstanding. And yet another
         bio to add - this one of someone who is actually under 40 years old and not Jewish (well, Richard and Wade aren't
         actually Jewish but we've made them honorary Jews for the duration).</p>
