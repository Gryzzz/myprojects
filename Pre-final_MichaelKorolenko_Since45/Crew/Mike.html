               <p> Here's Michael Korolenko's - co-producer, director, co-writer of Since '45X:
          Korolenko received his Masters of Science degree for his thesis film, "SINCE '45,"
          a documentary on recent American history and the media. The film went on to win a student
           Academy Award for Best Documentary as well as the Focus Competition Award. It was screened 
           at both FILMEX in Los Angeles and the New York Film Festival and was televised nationally
           on Showtime, the Discovery Channel, and Jim Lehrer's PBS series "U.S. Chronicle." "SINCE '45X" 
           will be an expanded version of this film. Korolenko also created an interactive multimedia science
            lesson chosen by IBM for use throughout Europe, a project on which he foolishly accepted a flat fee.
            He also made numerous independent films, including "CHORDS OF FAME, " a musical biography about American
            folk singer Phil Ochs and the 1960's, and a short electric folk operetta," "TAMLIN," based on an old Scottish ballad, as well as numerous corporate films.
           Since moving to the Seattle area, Korolenko has continued to make films as well as write short stories and text books.
          He also directed a short Twilight Zone like fantasy and worked on another textbook, "Digital Futurama". Korolenko is also an 
           adviser for the Presidential Committee on New Media.</p>
