        <p>Editor / Co-Writer / Post- Supervisor</p>
        <p>With one Oscar winner, (KARL HESS, 1981), two documentary nominees (KUDZU, URGE TO BUILD), Loren’s editing work also includes
          Michael Korolenko's SINCE '45, a student Oscar winner in 1979.
          In a 30-year career, Loren has navigated a dual track of editor and producer. He’s edited a full range of projects from dramatic
          indie features to short-form, cause-related videos. He went digital on Avid in 1994 and Final Cut Pro in 1999. For PBS he edited highly
          rated hours of Antiques Roadshow, and contributed to other series. He’s edited shows for Discovery, Annenberg Channel, and HGTV. His
          1990 short documentary Invention! won Gold at Worldfest Houston. Today he produces process traces of designers, builders, and inventors,
          utilizing his skills in the standard complement of creative software. He has taught college-level editing at Boston University, Emerson
          College and the Rockport, Maine TV and Film Workshops, and edits for independent longform producers coast to coast. He has tech edited 
            for Pearson and Focal Press, who have also licensed his software KeyGuides™.</p>
